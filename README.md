# NMPC-and-VO-for-Mobile-Robot
Nonlinear Model Predictive Control and Velocity Obstacle Method for Turtle bot in RVIZ Environment

To test these algorithms you need to build the rviz environment using catkin.

Once the environment is built , launch the simualtion environment by using the following command 

`roslaunch rbe500 dynamic_obstacle-scenario.launch`

After the environment is launched , just run the correpsponding algotihm files. For example, to test NMPC , run rviz_nmpc.py file by using below command 

`python rviz_nmpc.py`
